# Lab 8: Build and Publish a Custom Microsoft 365 Copilot Cowork Plugin

Estimated Duration: 20 minutes

## Lab Overview

Microsoft 365 Copilot can be extended using Copilot Cowork Plugins,
enabling organizations to integrate enterprise knowledge, business
processes, and external services directly into Copilot experiences.

In this lab you will build a Financial Research Plugin that extends
Microsoft 365 Copilot with live financial research capabilities by
connecting to the Contoso public repository through a Remote Model
Context Protocol (MCP) Server.

Instead of manually authoring the plugin, you will use a single
structured AI prompt to generate a complete, deployment-ready plugin
package. You will then review the generated assets, validate the
package, publish it through the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, and test the
plugin inside Copilot Cowork.

The build prompt specifies the required Microsoft 365 Unified App
Manifest structure, plugin skills, connector configuration, packaging
rules, validation requirements, and deployment process — so the AI
produces a package that is ready to upload without hand-editing.

> [!NOTE]
> **What is MCP?**
>
> The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely connect to external tools and data sources through a standardized interface.
>
> In this lab, the plugin uses a **Remote MCP Server**, which hosts the required tools and retrieves live data from the **SEC EDGAR** service at runtime. This means the plugin does **not** store or bundle the data itself—it queries the remote service whenever a user makes a request, ensuring the information is current.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Launch Microsoft 365 Copilot and enable Copilot Cowork.

- Generate a complete Copilot Cowork plugin package using a structured
  AI prompt.

- Understand the structure of a Microsoft 365 Copilot plugin (manifest,
  skills, connector, icons).

- Review the generated manifest, skills, and connector configuration.

- Validate the plugin package against the devPreview schema before
  deployment.

- Publish the plugin through the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.

- Test plugin functionality inside Microsoft 365 Copilot Cowork using
  natural-language queries.

## Lab Prerequisites

- Microsoft 365 Copilot license (Premium).

- Copilot Cowork enabled for your account.

- Microsoft 365 Administrator (Global Admin or equivalent) permissions.

- Internet access and a modern web browser (Microsoft Edge or Chrome
  recommended).

- Access to Microsoft 365 Copilot or Claude for AI-assisted plugin
  generation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Administrator permissions are required** to upload a custom app through the **Microsoft 365 Admin Center**.
>
> If you are using a **training** or **ODL sandbox**, sign in with the **administrator account** provided for the lab—not your personal Microsoft account.
>
> Without administrator permissions, you will **not** be able to complete **Exercises 5 and 6**.

# **Solution Overview**

## **What Are We Building?**

You will build a Financial Research Plugin for Microsoft 365 Copilot
Cowork. The plugin extends Copilot with specialized financial-research
capabilities using publicly available SEC filing data.

Rather than relying only on Copilot's built-in knowledge, the plugin
connects to a Remote MCP Server that exposes SEC EDGAR data. When a user
asks a financial question, Copilot selects the appropriate skill,
retrieves the required information from the SEC EDGAR service, and
returns a summarized, formatted response.

## **Plugin Architecture**

    B --> D[Plugin Manifest]
    B --> E[MCP Connector]

    E --> F[SEC EDGAR Public Server]
    F --> G[Financial Filing Data]
```

## **Plugin Components**

The generated plugin package consists of:

- A Microsoft 365 Unified App Manifest (manifest.json).

- Seven Copilot skills (one SKILL.md per skill folder).

- A single Remote MCP Connector (SEC EDGAR public server).

- Two plugin icons: color.png (192 × 192) and outline.png (32 × 32).

- A single deployment package (ZIP) with manifest.json at the root.

The package follows the Microsoft 365 Unified App Manifest (devPreview)
schema and includes all assets required for deployment.

## **Skills Included in the Plugin**

The plugin contains seven specialized skills that map natural-language
requests to financial-research tasks. Each skill uses the SEC EDGAR MCP
connector to retrieve and summarize public-company information.

## Available Skills

| Skill | Description | Example Prompt |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Company Snapshot** | Retrieves a company's profile, business overview, and key financial information. | `Give me a snapshot of Microsoft.` |
| **Financial Trends** | Analyzes historical revenue, profit, and growth trends over time. | `Show Microsoft's five-year revenue trend.` |
| **Peer Comparison** | Compares two or more public companies using key financial metrics. | `Compare Microsoft and Amazon.` |
| **Risk Factor Analysis** | Reviews risk disclosures from SEC filings and summarizes key risks. | `What risks are listed in Microsoft's latest 10-K?` |
| **Earnings Deep Dive** | Summarizes quarterly earnings reports and highlights business performance. | `Analyze Microsoft's latest earnings.` |
| **Executive Research** | Retrieves executive leadership information and executive compensation details. | `Who is Microsoft's CEO?` |
| **Filing Search** | Searches SEC filings using keywords, phrases, or topics. | `Find filings mentioning Artificial Intelligence.` |

> [!NOTE]
> **Common SEC Filing Types**
>
> - **10-K** – Annual report containing audited financial statements, business overview, and risk factors.
> - **10-Q** – Quarterly report providing financial updates between annual reports.
> - **8-K** – Current report filed to disclose significant business events between regular reporting periods.
> - **DEF 14A** – Proxy statement containing executive compensation, board information, and shareholder voting matters.

*Figure 1 — The Cowork tab in Microsoft 365 Copilot. Note the New task,
My tasks, Scheduled, and Customize items in the left rail.*

> [!TIP]
> **Chat vs. Copilot Cowork**
>
> - **Chat** is designed for quick questions and conversational interactions.
> - **Copilot Cowork** is the task-oriented, agentic workspace where **skills** and **plugins** execute multi-step workflows.
>
> In this lab, your **Financial Research** plugin runs in **Copilot Cowork**. Before continuing, verify that the **Cowork** tab is selected.

4.  Open the composer menu (the + in the task box) and choose Customize
    to manage skills & plugins.

> [!NOTE]
> **If you don't see Copilot Cowork**
>
> Copilot Cowork (sometimes labeled **Frontier**) is enabled on a **per-tenant** and **per-license** basis. If the **Cowork** tab is not available:
>
> 1. Verify that your account has a **Microsoft 365 Copilot Premium** license assigned.
> 2. Confirm that **Copilot Cowork** has been enabled for your Microsoft 365 tenant by an administrator.
>
> After a license is assigned, it may take some time for the **Cowork** experience to become available.

### **Expected Result**

Copilot Cowork is available and ready for plugin development.

# **Exercise 2 — Generate the Plugin Using AI**

Duration: ~20 minutes

### **Objective**

Generate a complete Microsoft 365 Copilot Cowork plugin package using a
single structured AI prompt.

## Task 1 — Start a New AI Session

Open a new chat / task in Microsoft 365 Copilot. Using a fresh session
ensures previous conversations do not influence the generated output.

![](./media/dc77ca333645c9e4a3bf1c11314a36205848e050.png)

*Figure 4 — Starting a new task in Cowork. A clean session gives the
most predictable, repeatable output.*

> [!TIP]
> **Why a Fresh Session Matters**
>
> Large language models use the context from earlier messages in a conversation to generate responses. As a result, previous interactions can influence the current task—for example, by reusing an existing GUID, skipping required files, or generating a different folder structure.
>
> Starting with a **new Copilot Cowork session** helps ensure consistent, predictable results that match the steps and screenshots in this lab guide.

## Task 2 — Review the Plugin Generation Prompt

The build prompt instructs the AI to generate a Financial Research
plugin package that includes a Unified App Manifest, seven research
skills, a Remote MCP connector, plugin icons, and a deployment-ready
ZIP. It also defines the required folder structure, manifest schema,
validation rules, packaging process, and deployment guidance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Read the Prompt Before You Run It**
>
> This prompt defines the complete specification for the plugin. Reviewing it before execution will help you verify that the generated output is correct in **Exercise 3**.
>
> Pay particular attention to these common validation requirements:
>
> - **`agentSkills`** and **`agentConnectors`** must be **top-level properties** in the manifest. They must **not** be nested under `copilotAgents`.
> - The manifest must include **`manifestVersion: "devPreview"`** and a valid **`packageName`**.
> - Every **`SKILL.md`** file must define **`metadata.cowork.category`** and **`metadata.cowork.icon`** under the **`metadata`** section.

### **The Complete Build Prompt**

Copy the entire block below exactly as written.
## Plugin Generation Prompt

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Copy the entire prompt below exactly as shown and paste it into a **new Copilot Cowork session**. Do not modify the prompt unless instructed by the lab.

> [!NOTE]
> **Why Two Icons?**
>
> The plugin package includes two icon files, each serving a different purpose in Microsoft 365:
>
> - **`color.png`** – A **192 × 192** full-color icon displayed in app galleries, search results, and information cards.
> - **`outline.png`** – A **32 × 32** monochrome icon used in compact user interface elements such as toolbars, navigation menus, and the skills list.
>
> Both icons are **required** by the Microsoft 365 Unified App Manifest. During package validation, the icons are checked to ensure they exist and match the required dimensions:
>
> - **`color.png`** – **192 × 192** pixels
> - **`outline.png`** – **32 × 32** pixels

- MCP connector — confirm the SEC EDGAR connector is present with the
  correct remote MCP server URL and “None” authorization.

Verify the manifest and skill metadata follow the required structure:
top-level agentSkills and agentConnectors, and correctly nested
metadata.cowork.category and metadata.cowork.icon fields.

# Exercise 4 — Validate the Plugin

### **Objective**

Use the validation checklist from the build prompt to confirm the
package is correct before deployment.

Work through each item and confirm it passes:

- manifest.json is at the ZIP root.

- Uses the Microsoft Teams vDevPreview schema.

- manifestVersion = devPreview.

- packageName is present.

- A new GUID v4 was generated for id.

- agentSkills is a top-level property.

- agentConnectors is a top-level property.

- All seven skill folders exist, each with a valid SKILL.md.

- metadata.cowork.category and metadata.cowork.icon are nested
  correctly.

- color.png is 192 × 192 and outline.png is 32 × 32.

- validDomains contains secedgar.caseyjhand.com.

- The ZIP was rebuilt after the latest edits.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Rebuild the ZIP After Every Change**
>
> If you modify **any** file after creating the ZIP package (for example, updating `manifest.json` or a `SKILL.md` file), you **must** rebuild the ZIP before uploading it.
>
> The **Microsoft 365 Admin Center** validates the **ZIP package** that you upload—not the individual files in your project folder. Uploading an outdated ZIP will publish the previous, uncorrected version of the plugin.

> [!TIP]
> **Common Validation Failures**
>
> - **Manifest is not valid** – Typically caused by:
>   - `agentSkills` or `agentConnectors` being nested under `copilotAgents`
>   - `manifestVersion` not set to `devPreview`
> - **Icons rejected** – The icon files have incorrect dimensions or are not in **RGBA PNG** format.
> - **Skill ignored** – `cowork.category` or `cowork.icon` is defined at the top level instead of under the `metadata` section in `SKILL.md`.
> - **Registered as a Teams-only app** – The package was uploaded through the **Teams Admin Center** instead of the **Microsoft 365 Admin Center**.

# Exercise 5 — Publish the Plugin

### **Objective**

Upload and deploy the validated plugin through the Microsoft 365 Admin
Center.

13. Navigate to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center at
    https://admin.cloud.microsoft.

*Figure 36 — Selecting the app type (Teams app) in the Deploy New App
wizard.*

> [!NOTE]
> **Why Select "Teams app"?**
>
> Although you are deploying a **Microsoft 365 Copilot Cowork** plugin, the package uses the **Microsoft 365 Unified App Manifest** and is uploaded through the **Teams app** option in the **Microsoft 365 Admin Center**.
>
> This is the expected deployment workflow. Selecting **Teams app** in the upload wizard and publishing the package through the **Microsoft 365 Admin Center** (rather than the **Teams Admin Center**) ensures that the plugin is registered correctly as a **Copilot Cowork** plugin.

18. Click Choose File, then browse and select the ZIP
    (microsoft-financial-research-tools.zip).

> [!TIP]
> **Assign to Yourself First**
>
> For a lab, proof of concept, or pilot deployment, assign the plugin to **Just me** (or a small test group) before making it broadly available.
>
> This approach allows you to:
>
> - Verify that the plugin installs and functions correctly.
> - Validate the skills, connector, and user experience in a controlled environment.
> - Resolve any issues before expanding the assignment to a larger audience.
>
> After successful testing, you can assign the plugin to **All users** or additional groups from the app's details page in the **Microsoft 365 Admin Center**.

23. On Review and finish deployment, confirm the settings and click
    Finish deployment.

> [!NOTE]
> **Deployment Propagation**
>
> After the plugin is successfully deployed, it may take a few minutes before it becomes available to assigned users in **Copilot Cowork**.
>
> If the plugin does not appear immediately:
>
> - Wait a few minutes for the deployment to propagate.
> - Refresh the **Copilot Cowork** page or restart the application.
> - Verify that the plugin has been assigned to your account or user group in the **Microsoft 365 Admin Center**.

*Figure 54 — Financial Research enabled (toggle on) in Customize.*

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Publisher Not Verified**
>
> Because this plugin is a **custom side-loaded app**, Copilot may display a **Publisher not verified** or **Missing attestation** notice on the **Security & Compliance** tab.
>
> This behavior is **expected** for lab and development packages and **does not affect the plugin's functionality**.
>
> For production environments, only deploy applications from **verified publishers** that have completed the appropriate validation and attestation process. Avoid distributing unverified custom apps broadly across a production tenant.

# **Exercise 6 — Test the Plugin**

Duration: ~15 minutes

### **Objective**

Confirm the plugin works end to end: the correct skill is triggered, the
MCP connector retrieves SEC EDGAR data, and Copilot returns a
well-formatted response.

Open Microsoft 365 Copilot Cowork and test the following prompts:

- Give me a snapshot of Microsoft.

- Compare Microsoft and Google.

- Analyze Microsoft's latest earnings.

- Show Microsoft's five-year revenue trend.

- What are Microsoft's risk factors?

- Who is Microsoft's CEO?

- Find filings mentioning Artificial Intelligence.

32. Navigate back to the Cowork chat window.

Verify that the appropriate skill is invoked, the MCP connector
retrieves SEC EDGAR data, and Copilot returns a well-formatted response.

> [!NOTE]
> **How Ticker Resolution Works**
>
> The plugin uses a company's **ticker symbol** to retrieve information from the **SEC EDGAR** service.
>
> For example, when you ask:
>
> ```text
> Give me a snapshot of Microsoft.
> ```
>
> The plugin first resolves the company name to its stock ticker:
>
> ```text
> Microsoft → MSFT
> ```
>
> It then uses the **MSFT** ticker to query the **SEC EDGAR MCP** server and retrieve the company's public filings and financial data, including:
>
> - Company profile
> - **10-K** annual reports
> - **10-Q** quarterly reports
> - **8-K** current reports
> - Financial statements
> - Executive leadership information
> - Risk factors
>
> This ticker resolution process allows the plugin to locate the correct company and retrieve the latest publicly available information from the SEC EDGAR database.

### **Expected Result**

Each prompt triggers the matching skill, the SEC EDGAR MCP connector
returns filing data, and Copilot presents a clear, formatted answer.

# Lab Summary

In this lab, you:

- Enabled Microsoft 365 Copilot Cowork.

- Generated a complete Financial Research plugin package using a single
  structured AI prompt.

- Reviewed the generated manifest, seven skills, connector, and icons.

- Validated the package against the devPreview schema.

- Published the plugin through the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.

- Enabled and tested the plugin in Copilot Cowork using natural-language
  financial queries backed by live SEC EDGAR data.

## **Key Takeaways**

- Copilot plugins are just a manifest + skills + connector packaged as a
  ZIP — the structure is what matters, not hand-written code.

- A well-specified prompt can generate a deployment-ready package, but
  you must still review and validate the output.

- The manifest shape (top-level agentSkills / agentConnectors,
  devPreview version, nested cowork metadata) is the single biggest
  source of upload failures.

- Remote MCP connectors let a plugin pull live external data without
  bundling it, keeping the package small and always current.
